    "We can see that our model would have been marginally (2.81%) profitable had we bet on every game where the model predicted the player to win and the model’s odds were lower than the bookmaker's. While this is encouraging and suggests that the model may be identifying genuine value, it's important to interpret these results with caution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sports betting outcomes are inherently noisy and prone to short-term fluctuations. A 2.81% edge, while statistically promising, can easily be wiped out by variance, particularly over smaller sample sizes or streaky outcomes. Additionally, betting markets evolve — the model's performance may degrade over time as bookmakers adjust, market efficiency improves, or player dynamics shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also worth noting that a model showing marginal profitability under simulated conditions doesn’t guarantee consistent success in live betting environments. Factors like odds movement (line changes), delays in placing bets, limited market liquidity, and bet restrictions can all affect real-world returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, this initial performance provides a strong foundation. With further refinement — such as improved feature engineering, dynamic model calibration, or integration of live odds tracking — the model could potentially deliver more robust and sustainable profits over time."
